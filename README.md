# Application is ready
 ## use npm start or npm run start to run the app on localhost
 ## I tried my best to deliver the solution of the task
 ## I was not sure what to include in the form when Book Ticket button is clicked so i just created an input field which stores the user name in localstorage and display accordingly on the page
 ## I have made the page responsive and screenshots of it are shared through google form

 #Thank you
